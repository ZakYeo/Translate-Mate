Open-source translation chat-bot that works in Discord using their API. (See https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro)

I am using Pycord, which gives me functionality of slash commands and a lot more (See https://pycord.dev/)

This application uses DeepL's translation API in order to function. It allows for translation capabilities (See https://www.deepl.com/docs-api)

On top of this I use a Python library known as langdetect (Se https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/)

In order to get this application running, you may simply clone the repo and insert your DeepL & Discord keys into main.py then run main.py for the app to begin. Alternatively, if you already have a discord bot you can just clone/download the translator_cog.py and load the cog extension into your own code.

See https://docs.pycord.dev/en/master/ext/commands/cogs.html for more information on cogs.

Thank you.
